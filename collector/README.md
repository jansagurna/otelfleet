# otelfleet collector distribution

Custom OpenTelemetry Collector distribution for the otelfleet ingest tier
(gateway) and the forwarding tier, built with the
[OpenTelemetry Collector Builder (OCB)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/custom-collector/).

Pinned release train: **collector core v1.62.0 / v0.156.0, contrib v0.156.0,
OCB v0.156.0** (see `builder-config.yaml`).

## Components

| Kind | Components |
| --- | --- |
| Receivers | `otlp` |
| Processors | `memory_limiter`, `batch`, **`tenantstamp`** (local), `filter`, `transform`, `attributes`, `resource` |
| Exporters | `clickhouse`, `prometheusremotewrite`, `debug`, `otlp`, `otlphttp`, `file` |
| Connectors | `count`, `routing` |
| Extensions | **`tenantauth`** (local), `file_storage`, `health_check`, `pprof` |
| Providers | `env`, `file`, `http`, `https`, `yaml` |

The forwarding tier loads its entire (control-plane-rendered) config through
the `http` confmap provider
(`--config=http://.../internal/v1/collector-config/forwarding`);
`testdata/forwarding-sample.yaml` is the contract test for the rendered
config shape and is checked by `make -C collector validate`.

Local components (own Go modules, wired in via `replaces`):

- [`extension/tenantauth`](extension/tenantauth) — server authenticator that
  validates ingest API keys against the control plane's
  `otelfleet.auth.v1.AuthService` (gRPC, `proto/authservice.proto`) with a
  positive/negative/stale-if-error cache, and attaches the tenant identity to
  `client.Info`.
- [`processor/tenantstamp`](processor/tenantstamp) — stamps
  `tenant.id` / `client.id` / `customer.id` from the authenticated identity
  onto every resource (removing client-supplied values first) and drops
  unauthenticated data.

## Building

```sh
make -C collector build      # go run go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/builder@v0.156.0
make -C collector test       # unit tests for the local components
make -C collector validate   # validate deploy/compose/otelcol-gateway.yaml
make -C collector docker     # docker build -f Dockerfile.collector (repo root context)
make -C collector proto      # regenerate tenantauth's AuthService stubs
```

The binary lands in `collector/dist/otelfleet-collector` (gitignored).

The container image is built by `Dockerfile.collector` at the repo root
(multi-stage: OCB in `golang:1.26`, runtime `distroless/static` running as
non-root) and consumed by the `gateway` service in
`deploy/compose/docker-compose.yaml` with
`deploy/compose/otelcol-gateway.yaml` as its config.

## Edge agent (OpAMP supervisor)

P3 edge agents run this same collector distribution under the
[OpAMP supervisor](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/v0.156.0/cmd/opampsupervisor)
(**opampsupervisor v0.156.0**, matching the collector release train). The
supervisor dials the control plane's OpAMP server
(`ws://host.docker.internal:4320/v1/opamp` in dev), authenticates with a
per-customer bootstrap token (`Authorization: Bearer otm_bt_<prefix>_<secret>`),
receives the full collector config as OpAMP remote config, runs the collector
as a child process, reports health / effective config / remote-config status,
persists the last-good config under `/var/lib/otelfleet-supervisor`, and
reverts to it locally when a pushed config crash-loops.

- Image: `Dockerfile.supervisor` (repo root). The supervisor binary is copied
  from the official `opentelemetry-collector-opampsupervisor:0.156.0` release
  image (`go install` of the module is impossible at v0.156.0 — its go.mod
  has replace directives); the collector binary is built with OCB exactly
  like `Dockerfile.collector` (intentional duplication for now).
- Supervisor config: `deploy/compose/supervisor.yaml`. The supervisor's own
  config supports confmap `${env:VAR}` expansion, which injects
  `OTELFLEET_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` into the Authorization header.
- Compose service: `edge-agent` in `deploy/compose/docker-compose.yaml`,
  behind the `edge` profile (it needs a real token):
  `OTELFLEET_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN=otm_bt_... docker compose --profile edge up -d edge-agent`.

NOTE: the supervisor requires the managed collector to include the contrib
`opamp` extension (it injects an `extensions: opamp:` block into every config
it hands the collector). `builder-config.yaml` does not list it yet, so
`Dockerfile.supervisor` patches `opampextension v0.156.0` into the manifest at
image build time. TODO: add
`github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/extension/opampextension v0.156.0`
to `builder-config.yaml` and drop that patch.

## Version bumps

When bumping the collector release train, update in lockstep:

1. `OCB_VERSION` in `collector/Makefile` and `Dockerfile.collector`.
2. All `gomod` pins in `builder-config.yaml`.
3. The collector API deps of `extension/tenantauth` and
   `processor/tenantstamp` (`go get ... && go mod tidy`).
4. Re-verify `deploy/clickhouse/schema/*.sql` against the clickhouse
   exporter's insert statements (`internal/sqltemplates/*_insert.sql` in the
   pinned exporter) — the exporter runs with `create_schema: false` and the
   DDL is owned here.
