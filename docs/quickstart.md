# Quickstart

Two ways to get a running otelfleet in about five minutes:

- **[Demo mode](#demo-mode-everything-in-containers)** — everything in containers,
  one command, no toolchain needed beyond Docker.
- **[Development mode](#development-mode-control-plane-on-the-host)** — control
  plane and web UI on the host, for hacking on otelfleet itself.

## Demo mode (everything in containers)

Requirements: Docker with Compose v2.23.1+ (the demo file uses inline `configs`).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jansagurna/otelfleet
cd otelfleet
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.demo.yaml up -d --build
```

This starts PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, VictoriaMetrics, vmagent, the control plane
(as a container, with the web UI and collector binary baked in), the ingest
gateway, and the forwarding tier.

!!! note

    The demo uses the same host ports as the development environment
    (8080, 4317/4318, 4320, 5432, 8123/9000, 8428) — stop `make dev-up` /
    `make run` first. The `OTELFLEET_MASTER_KEY` in the demo file is a
    **published sample**; never reuse it outside a demo.

1. Open <http://localhost:8080>. Dev login is enabled — sign in with any email
   address.
2. Create a **customer**, then create an **API key** for it. The key is shown
   **once** — copy it now.
3. Send data with the bundled load generator:

    ```sh
    OTELFLEET_API_KEY=otm_... docker compose \
      -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.demo.yaml --profile loadgen up loadgen
    ```

4. Watch the customer's throughput charts fill up on the dashboard and the
   customer detail page (ingest counters come straight from the gateway's
   `count` connector, labeled by `tenant.id`).

Tear down with:

```sh
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.demo.yaml down -v
```

## Development mode (control plane on the host)

Requirements: Go 1.26+, Node 24+ with pnpm, Docker + Compose.

### 1. Start the backing services

```sh
make dev-up   # postgres, clickhouse, victoriametrics, vmagent, gateway, forwarding
```

This is `deploy/compose/docker-compose.yaml`: everything except the control plane.
The gateway resolves API keys against the control plane on the host
(`host.docker.internal:9443`), and the forwarding collector pulls its rendered
config from the host ops listener — both crash-loop harmlessly until step 2.

### 2. Run the control plane

```sh
OTELFLEET_DEV_LOGIN=true \
OTELFLEET_MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32) \
make run
```

- `OTELFLEET_DEV_LOGIN=true` enables password-less login with any email.
- `OTELFLEET_MASTER_KEY` (base64-encoded 32 bytes) is optional for the core loop
  but required to store SSO providers and pipeline password fields. **Persist the
  key** (e.g. in a local env file) — secrets encrypted with a lost key are
  unrecoverable.
- Pipeline validation shells out to the real collector binary; build it once with
  `make -C collector build` (expected at `collector/dist/otelfleet-collector`,
  override with `OTELFLEET_OTELCOL_BIN`). Without it, validation degrades to
  structural checks.

### 3. Start the web UI

```sh
cd web && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Open the Vite dev server (it proxies API calls to `:8080`) and log in with any
email. To make yourself an admin, set
`OTELFLEET_ADMIN_EMAILS=you@example.com` in step 2.

### 4. Create a customer and send data

Create a customer and an API key in the UI (the key is shown once), then:

```sh
telemetrygen logs --otlp-insecure --otlp-endpoint localhost:4317 \
  --otlp-header 'authorization="Bearer <api-key>"'
```

(`go install github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/cmd/telemetrygen@v0.156.0`
if you don't have it.)

### 5. Watch the charts

The dashboard and the customer's detail page show accepted log records / spans /
metric points within a scrape interval (~15s). Rows land tenant-tagged in
ClickHouse; an invalid key shows up as refused requests.
