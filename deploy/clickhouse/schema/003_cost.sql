-- P5: byte accounting for the cost dashboard. ingest_counts_1m gains a Bytes
-- column (estimated in-memory row size via byteSize(*), not compressed-at-rest
-- size); the materialized views are recreated to feed it. MVs only apply to
-- new inserts — historic rows keep Bytes=0, which the cost API documents.
--
-- Existing dev volumes need this applied manually (initdb only runs on fresh
-- volumes): docker exec otelfleet-dev-clickhouse-1 clickhouse-client
--   --user otelfleet --password otelfleet --queries-file /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/003_cost.sql
